# PATH-FINDING
Path Finding Algo
Dijkstra's Algorithm was developed in 1956 by Edsger W. Dijkstra, a Dutch computer scientist, and published in 1959. The algorithm was initially designed to find the shortest path between two cities in the Netherlands but has since become one of the fundamental algorithms in graph theory and computer science.

Dijkstra's Algorithm is widely used in various applications, such as:

Routing in computer networks (e.g., OSPF and IS-IS protocols)
Navigation systems (e.g., GPS applications)
AI pathfinding (e.g., game development and robotics)
Dijkstraâ€™s work laid the foundation for many advancements in graph algorithms and optimization techniques, influencing the fields of computer science and operations research significantly.
